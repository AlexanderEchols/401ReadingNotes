# ***Growth Mindset***

### **Deliberate Practice:**
This is clearly important as we all want to be better at what we are doing with our life and this is a method that shows real results. I am learning the piano now as well, and the reading is correct in that “you need to practice, not just play”. If that statement is true with piano it only makes sense that it would apply in work too.

### **Grit:**
This was an interesting watch, and where as I don’t plan on having kids nor teaching children, I can still apply this to not only my nieces and nephews, but also myself. I have often said that I believe my family is a gov’t experiment to see what can get you further talent(my sister), intelligence(my brother) or determination(me) and both my parents think I am the best child they had. Determination/Grit wins

### **Redefining Success:**
This (in my opinion) is crucial. I definitely have a hard time with “success” and what it means to me. My father absolutely influenced my choices on what makes a person a success, my mother did too but not to the same degree as when I was younger. I will say I am trying to decide what I believe success is. My father definitely believes it is the ability to care for those in your charge, and even gave me a somewhat hard time when I was not looking for work and instead focusing on my health saying things like “well son, YOU should really be the one providing for your family”. Like I said it still somewhat affects me, but I think I am moving to more success being the amount of joy you have and bring, and not my station (as the video put it). Side note, can we go back to calling poor people “unblessed” instead of “poor loser”?

### **Self-Assessment Tool:**

1. Self-Awareness: 4+4+3+4+1=16
2. Self-Management: 3+5+4+3+4=19
3. Social Awareness: 3+2+2+1+1=9
4. Relationship Management: 5+4+3+3+3=18

### **Bias_Assessment:**

Turns out "Empathy and Curiosity" is one of my lowest totals, which I don't think should not be together, I am an extremely curious person who happens to struggle with understanding other people's emotions. 

In the coming weeks I will be focused on probably meaningful connections the most, however in the long term or "beyond" as you put it, I am going to try and work on my empathy. Curiosity is pretty much always getting work.
