# SOC 2 Compliance:
This is important as understanding SOC 2 Compliance can help us to keep networks/organizations secure and reliable. As security personnel that kinda seems right in our wheelhouse.
1. Do you store your customers data in the cloud, do you want to do business with enterprise level customers or do you want to give your customers the enterprise level experience? If the answer to either of those was yes, you need to be SOC 2 compliant. This is not a set of hard and fast rules but a framework to help prove your organization prioritizes the key attributes of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and (last but not least) privacy. On top of that, being SOC2 compliant will improve security, bolster company culture, give your company solid documentation (never too early for that), and help with risk management.

2. The five SOC2 Trust Principles are: 
    * Security: Foundational security principle, common to all audits 
    * Availability: Protection that systems or data will be available as agreed/required
    * Processing Integrity: System or data are not changed in an unauthorized manner
    * Confidentiality: No unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data
    * Privacy: Use, collection, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal info is protected

3. The three levels of SOC2 pyramid are:
    * Top - Proof: supporting Documentation, shows you did what you said you did. - Here is the recipe we used and the brownies themselves.
    * Middle - Execution: Security Procedures, Tells how you do what you say you do. - we do this by mixing ingredients and baking in the oven at a specific temp
    * Base - Foundation: Security Policies, What you say you do. - We make brownies


## What I want to know more:
What is the biggest section of audits and what touches on every aspect of information security controls? **Common Criteria**. A **Common Criteria Audit** can be done by a company to keep the scope of the audit small. Typically a **Common Criteria Audit** will touch on the following criteria:
- Organization & Management
- Communications
- Risk Management
- Monitoring of Controls
- Logical & Physical Access Controls
- System Operations
- Change Management

How long does the process take? Typically a company will spend 6 months to a year on just the preparation for a SOC2 Audit. This process will involve IDing the systems to be audited, policy and procedure development, and implementation of new security controls to reduce risks. After the prep process, the company will hire a licensed CPA auditor. The actual audit will take two days and several hours of phone conversations.
